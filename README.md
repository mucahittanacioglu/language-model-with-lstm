# language-model-with-lstm
Craeting language model base on LSTM with public ebook.
For TR model I have used [Mevlanadan Se√ßmeler](https://hattusa.live/kitaplar/mevlana-mevlana-celaleddin-ruminin-butun-eserlerinden-secmeler) ebook and [Turkish-GloVe](https://github.com/inzva/Turkish-GloVe) as embedding.
Evaulating the result kinda hard because author's(Mevlana) style and structure of Turkish language.
