# language-model-with-lstm
Craeting language model base on LSTM with public ebook.
For TR model I have used (Mevlanadan Se√ßmeler)[https://hattusa.live/kitaplar/mevlana-mevlana-celaleddin-ruminin-butun-eserlerinden-secmeler] and (Turkish-GloVe)[https://github.com/inzva/Turkish-GloVe]
Evaulating the result kinda hard because author's(Mevlana) style and structure of Turkish language.
