# language-model-with-lstm
Craeting word level language model base on LSTM with public ebook.
For TR model(word based 5-->1)  I have used [Mevlanadan SeÃ§meler](https://hattusa.live/kitaplar/mevlana-mevlana-celaleddin-ruminin-butun-eserlerinden-secmeler) ebook and [Turkish-GloVe](https://github.com/inzva/Turkish-GloVe) as embedding.

For EN model(character based 25-->1) I have used [Tolstoy's War&Peace](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2600) ebook and [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) as embedding.
